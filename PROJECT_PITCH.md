# üé§ Meeting & Lecture Summarizer: Project Pitch

## üí° The Inspiration

**The Problem:** Every day, millions of hours of valuable content are locked away in audio and video recordings. Students miss lectures, professionals can't attend crucial meetings, and educators struggle to create study materials. Traditional solutions require manual note-taking, expensive transcription services, or time-consuming content creation.

**The Vision:** What if we could transform any recording into a complete educational experience with just one click? Imagine uploading a lecture and instantly getting not just a transcript, but a comprehensive summary, a follow-up article, and even a comprehension test with answer keys.

**Personal Connection:** As students and professionals, we've all been there - scrambling to catch up after missing an important meeting or lecture, struggling to extract key insights from hours of recorded content, or spending weekends manually creating study materials. This tool democratizes access to comprehensive content analysis and educational material creation.

## üéØ Technical Challenges & Solutions

### **Challenge 1: File Processing Performance**
**Problem:** Large video files (100MB+) were causing timeouts and memory issues.

**Solution:**
- Implemented streaming file uploads with chunked processing
- Added background task queues using Celery for long-running operations
- Optimized FFmpeg parameters for faster audio extraction
- Progressive compression of video files before processing

```python
# Example: Streaming file upload with progress tracking
async def process_file_stream(file: UploadFile):
    async with aiofiles.open(temp_path, 'wb') as f:
        async for chunk in file.stream():
            await f.write(chunk)
            # Emit progress update via WebSocket
```

### **Challenge 2: AI Quality vs Speed Trade-offs**
**Problem:** Users wanted both fast processing and high-quality results.

**Solution:**
- Implemented tiered processing with user-selectable quality levels
- Model switching based on file characteristics (length, audio quality)
- Caching of expensive operations (embeddings, entity extraction)
- Progressive enhancement - basic results first, advanced features loading

### **Challenge 3: Real-time User Experience**
**Problem:** Processing takes 2-5 minutes; users needed engagement and progress updates.

**Solution:**
- WebSocket-based real-time progress tracking
- Staged processing with intermediate results display
- Optimistic UI updates and skeleton loading states
- Background processing with email notifications for very large files

### **Challenge 4: Semantic Search Accuracy**
**Problem:** Vector search was returning irrelevant results for complex queries.

**Solution:**
- Hybrid search combining vector similarity and keyword matching
- Query expansion using synonyms and related terms
- User feedback loop to improve search relevance
- Contextual re-ranking based on user interaction patterns

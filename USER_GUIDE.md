## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "OpenAI API Error"
```bash
# Check your API key in .env file
cat .env | grep OPENAI_API_KEY

# Verify API key format (should start with sk-)
# Check OpenAI account credits and usage limits
```

#### "File Processing Failed"
```bash
# Check file format and size
ls -lh your_file.mp4

# Ensure FFmpeg is installed
ffmpeg -version

# Try with a smaller file first
```

#### "Weaviate Connection Error"
```bash
# Check if Docker is running
docker ps

# Restart Weaviate container
docker restart weaviate-summarizer

# Or disable Weaviate in .env
ENABLE_WEAVIATE=false

# Check Weaviate health
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/meta
```

#### "GraphRAG Processing Slow"
```bash
# Reduce graph complexity in .env
GRAPHRAG_MAX_ENTITIES=100
GRAPHRAG_MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.8

# Use smaller knowledge graphs for faster processing
ENABLE_REAL_TIME_GRAPHS=false

# Check system memory usage
htop  # Ensure sufficient RAM for graph processing
```

#### "Web Research Not Working"
```bash
# Check API keys in .env file
cat .env | grep NEWS_API_KEY
cat .env | grep WEB_RESEARCH_API_KEY

# Test web connectivity
curl -I https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=test

# Disable web research temporarily
ENABLE_WEB_RESEARCH=false

# Check rate limits
# News API: 1000 requests/day for free tier
# Consider upgrading for production use
```

#### "Search Results Not Relevant"
```bash
# Rebuild Weaviate indexes
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/v1/schema/Recording

# Clear embedding cache
rm -rf ./cache/embeddings/*

# Adjust search parameters in settings:
SEARCH_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.7
SEARCH_MAX_RESULTS=20
ENABLE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
```

#### "Port Already in Use"
```bash
# Find process using the port
lsof -i :8000  # for FastAPI
lsof -i :3000  # for React

# Kill the process and restart
kill <PID>
```

### Performance Tips

#### For Large Files
- Use compressed audio formats (MP3 vs WAV)
- Split very long recordings into segments
- Use "base" Whisper model for faster processing
- Ensure sufficient disk space (2x file size)

#### For Better Quality
- Use high-quality audio recordings
- Minimize background noise
- Use "large" Whisper model for accuracy
- Enable speaker identification for multi-person meetings

## üìà Advanced Features

Our system leverages three cutting-edge technologies to provide advanced content analysis and discovery capabilities:

### üîç Weaviate Vector Database - Semantic Search Engine

**What it does:** Weaviate transforms your recordings into searchable knowledge using vector embeddings, enabling you to find content by meaning rather than just keywords.

#### How Weaviate Works in Our System:
```python
# When you upload a recording, we:
1. Split transcript into meaningful chunks (sentences/paragraphs)
2. Generate vector embeddings for each chunk using sentence transformers
3. Store vectors in Weaviate with metadata (timestamp, speaker, topic)
4. Enable semantic search across all your content
```

#### Real-World Examples:
**Traditional Search vs. Weaviate:**
- **Keyword search:** "budget" ‚Üí only finds exact word "budget"
- **Weaviate search:** "financial planning" ‚Üí finds "budget allocation", "cost management", "resource distribution"

**Practical Use Cases:**
```
üîç "Find discussions about team performance"
   ‚Üí Returns segments about "productivity", "employee reviews", "goal achievement"

üîç "What did we decide about the project timeline?"
   ‚Üí Returns decisions about "deadlines", "milestones", "delivery dates"

üîç "Show me content similar to this marketing strategy"
   ‚Üí Finds related discussions across different meetings
```

#### Configuration in Your System:
```bash
# In your .env file:
WEAVIATE_URL=http://localhost:8080
WEAVIATE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Weaviate automatically:
- Indexes new recordings as they're processed
- Updates embeddings when content is modified
- Provides sub-second search responses
```

#### Benefits You'll Experience:
- **Cross-recording discovery:** Find related topics across months of meetings
- **Intelligent suggestions:** System recommends related content automatically
- **Context-aware search:** Understands synonyms, related concepts, and context
- **Multilingual support:** Search in one language, find content in another

### üï∏Ô∏è GraphRAG - Knowledge Graph Intelligence

**What it does:** GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) builds knowledge graphs from your recordings, revealing hidden connections between people, topics, and decisions.

#### How GraphRAG Enhances Your Content:

**1. Entity Extraction & Relationship Mapping**
```python
# GraphRAG automatically identifies:
- People: "John mentioned the new project"
- Organizations: "Microsoft partnership discussion"
- Concepts: "Machine learning implementation"
- Relationships: "John manages the AI team"
```

**2. Knowledge Graph Construction**
```
    [John Smith] ‚îÄ‚îÄmanages‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [AI Team]
         ‚îÇ                      ‚îÇ
    mentioned                 working_on
         ‚îÇ                      ‚îÇ
         ‚ñº                      ‚ñº
    [New Project] ‚îÄ‚îÄuses‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Machine Learning]
```

**3. Graph-Enhanced Content Generation**
When creating summaries and articles, GraphRAG:
- Adds context about relationships between mentioned entities
- Identifies key decision makers and their roles
- Maps project dependencies and timelines
- Suggests related topics for deeper exploration

#### Real-World Applications:

**Meeting Analysis:**
- **Who's Connected:** "Show me everyone who worked on Project Alpha"
- **Decision Tracking:** "What decisions did Sarah make about the budget?"
- **Project Timelines:** "Map the evolution of our AI strategy"

**Knowledge Discovery:**
```
üìä Visual Knowledge Maps:
   - Topic clusters showing related concepts
   - Speaker interaction networks
   - Project dependency graphs
   - Decision flow diagrams
```

**Enhanced Search Results:**
Instead of just finding mentions, GraphRAG provides:
- **Context:** "John (CTO) mentioned AI budget (Project Alpha) in Q3 planning"
- **Relationships:** "This connects to previous discussions about team expansion"
- **Implications:** "Decision affects Marketing team timeline"

#### Integration Points:
```python
# GraphRAG enhances multiple features:
- Summary generation (adds relationship context)
- Article creation (includes background connections)
- Test questions (tests understanding of relationships)
- Search results (shows connected concepts)
```
